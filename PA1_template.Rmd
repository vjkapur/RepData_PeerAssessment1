# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
The goal of this report is to analyze...

## Loading and preprocessing the data
Data is in ```activity.zip```, included in this repository. It must be unzipped and read in:

```{r}
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
To determine the mean total number of steps taken per day, we can use the ```summaryBy``` function in the ```doBy``` package to sum steps per date, then take the mean of the results.

```{r}
##install.packages("doBy") ##(if necessary)
library(doBy)
by.date <- summaryBy(steps ~ date, data=data, FUN = sum, na.rm=TRUE)
plot(by.date) ##(unnecessary visualization for fun)
mean(by.date$steps.sum)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
